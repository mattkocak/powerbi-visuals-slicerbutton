# Slicer Button

## Description
A button that allows one to apply multiple slicers in a specified, predetermined way simply by clicking on it. A particularly powerful use case is making this button a transparent overlay over a Card visual. This essentially turns the Card visual into a clickable slicer without any of the potential limitations of a bookmark, which is the alternative to accomplish this.

## Features
- Slice number and text data type columns
- Slice up to two columns at the same time
- Slice based on specified comma-delimited **inclusion** list
- Format selection color and transparency
- Other common button formatting features
