# Slicer Button

## Description
A button that allows one to apply multiple slicers in a specified, predetermined way simply by clicking on it. A particularly powerful use case is making this button a transparent overlay over a [Card](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-card) visual. This essentially turns the Card visual into a clickable slicer without any of the potential limitations of a bookmark, which is the alternative to accomplish this.
